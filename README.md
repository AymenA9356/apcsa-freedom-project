# APCSA Freedom Project
by **X**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for AP Computer Science A is a year-long project all about making anything using technology.

For my project, I chose to independently study **Blender** in order to help me make **the 777-300ER**.

## Implications
##### PROS
* Helps visualize complex aircraft design in detail
* Enhances skills in Blender, which is used in industries like animation, simulation, and game design

* Encourages precision, planning, and problem-solving
##### CONS
* Time-consuming â€” detailed modeling takes many hours
* Not always accurate enough for real-world engineering use (unless measurements are exact)
* Requires a powerful computer to handle high-poly models and rendering
