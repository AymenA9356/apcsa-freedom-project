## Context

Giving my elevator pitch at the Expo taught me how to explain a complex project clearly and quickly.In less than a minute, I had to provide a synopsis of the complete modeling process, from obtaining references to producing the finished image. This improved my ability to prioritize the most crucial facts and talk confidently, even when I was anxious. I also discovered that my tone, tempo, and eye contact are just as important as my words. Receiving feedback and inquiries from others let me realize how fascinating and valuable my work is.


## Giving My In-Class Presentation

I had the opportunity to go deeper into the specifics of the 3D modeling process by giving a [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XjR45nqh56__BLysivu9SOZohuD81k8htH4WV-tW9EI/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p) in class. I discovered how to structure my explanation such that even people who were unfamiliar with Blender could follow along. My explanations were clearer when I used visual aids like screenshots and renderings, and I became aware of how much visual aids aid comprehension. It also taught me to shorten my presentation because I took more than 20min presenting. In general, my comfort level with technical communication and public speaking increased just because I had to present infront of other people that I dont know.

## Engineering Design Process

Currently we are in step 8 of the EDP which is `Communicate the results`. I gave in renders and what could be improved and what else needs to be optional.'

## Skills

I Have not learned any new skills but I have improved on them improving on how to debug and also how to read as a learning planemaker took a lot of reading from the documentation.
