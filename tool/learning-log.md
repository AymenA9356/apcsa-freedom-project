### 11/24/2024: Modelling the wings
The wings are coming along very well. But they do need some improvement as they do not match the outline of the frame and there are a lot of jagged edges and they need to be smoothed out to make them look good. But this is what they look like. This week I learned how to use the mirror function that Blender has this helped me save time as I did not need to make 2 wings. All I did was make one wing, Duplicate it, and then flip it on the x-axis to make it match the outline. The wing took me 30 minutes to make and the mirroring function took me 2 min so I saved 28min.
